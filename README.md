a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences. The goal of this 
landing page is to entice potential customers into using the product.

Now, I've finished the project for first release, hooray!
I could make this landing page responsive to cater for screen in different sizes.
This landing page is subject to change when the Excursion App would be available for download, which is
pending for new requirements. 

Manijeh was here, That's great Jerry.
